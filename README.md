# Fast-Window-Capture
Utility program designed to capture content of any window, even if it doesn't have a name.

It was originally designed to capture preview window of Aseprite, whih doesn't always have a name and can't be captured by OBS by standadr means. But this tools can be used for capturing any winows.   
Basic idea is that you can find any window be looking for a difference between lists of all the windows between to moments in time. In this way the only thing you need is to start a script and then open a winow you interested in.
